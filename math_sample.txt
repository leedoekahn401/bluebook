A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For
each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight
of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-
pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
A. 2
B. 4
C. 5
D. 6
ID: f224df07 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is correct. Let a equal the number of 120-pound packages, and let b equal the number of 100-pound packages. It’s given
that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality 
 represents this situation.
It’s also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality 
 represents this situation. Values of a
and b that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the
helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, a, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound
packages, b, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing b in terms of a in the second inequality yields 
, so the
minimum value of b is equal to 
 . Substituting 
  for b in the ﬁrst inequality results in 
 .
Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields 
 , or 
 .
Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields 
. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in 
 .
This means that the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly creating or solving the system of inequalities.

second equation in this system?
A. 
B. 
C.

ID: 4becad44 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is correct. A system of two linear equations in two variables,  and , has no solution when the lines in the xy-plane
representing the equations are parallel and distinct. Two lines are parallel and distinct if their slopes are the same and their y-
intercepts are different. The slope of the graph of the given equation, , in the xy-plane can be found by rewriting
the equation in the form , where  is the slope of the graph and  is the y-intercept. Adding  to each side of
the given equation yields . Dividing each side of this equation by  yields , or . It
follows that the slope of the graph of the given equation is  and the y-intercept is . Therefore, the graph of the second
equation in the system must also have a slope of , but must not have a y-intercept of . Multiplying each side of the
equation given in choice B by  yields  , or . It follows that the graph representing the equation in choice B has a
slope of  and a y-intercept of . Since the slopes of the graphs of the two equations are equal and the y-intercepts of the
graphs of the two equations are different, the equation in choice B could be the second equation in the system.
Choice A is incorrect. This equation can be rewritten as . It follows that the graph of this equation has a slope of , so the
system consisting of this equation and the given equation has exactly one solution, rather than no solution.
Choice C is incorrect. This equation can be rewritten as . It follows that the graph of this equation has a slope of 
and a y-intercept of , so the system consisting of this equation and the given equation has inﬁnitely many solutions, rather
than no solution.
Choice D is incorrect. This equation can be rewritten as . It follows that the graph of this equation has a slope of

A. 50
B. 72
C. 75
D. 132
ID: 41b71b4e Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is correct. The decimal equivalent of 20% is 0.2. The number that is 20% greater than 60 is also 120% of 60. The decimal
equivalent of 120% is 1.2, and 
 .
Alternate approach: 10% of 60 is 6, and 20% of 60 is double that amount, or 12. It follows that the number that is 20% greater than
60 is 12 more than 60, or 
 .
Choice A is incorrect and may result from dividing, instead of multiplying, 60 by 1.2. Choice C is incorrect because it’s 25% greater
than 60, rather than 20% greater than 60. Choice D is incorrect and may result from multiplying 60 by 2.2 instead of 1.2.

whether the watering pattern affects the trees’ growth rate. Based on the design of the study, what is the largest group to which
these results can be applied?
A. All the  baobab trees that were selected in this habitat 
B. All the baobab trees that were  years old in this habitat
C. All the baobab trees that were  years old in South Africa
D. All the baobab trees that were  years old in this habitat
ID: 6fca0144 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is correct. When a study uses a randomly selected sample, the largest group to which the results of the study can be
applied is the population from which the sample was selected. It's given that the scientist randomly selected the trees from the
baobab trees in a certain habitat that were  years old. Therefore, the largest group to which the results of this study can be
applied is all the baobab trees that were  years old in this habitat.
Choice A is incorrect. Since the sample was randomly selected from a population, the results can be applied to a larger group than
the sample.
Choice B is incorrect. The sample was selected from a population of baobab trees that were  years old, not  years old.

Anita created a batch of green paint by mixing 2 ounces of blue paint with 3 ounces of

paint as the ﬁrst batch. If she uses 5 ounces of blue paint for the second batch, how
much yellow paint should Anita use?
A. Exactly 5 ounces
B. 3 ounces more than the amount of yellow paint used in the ﬁrst batch
C. 1.5 times the amount of yellow paint used in the ﬁrst batch
D. 1.5 times the amount of blue paint used in the second batch
ID: 20b69297 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is correct. It’s given that Anita used a ratio of 2 ounces of blue paint to 3 ounces of yellow paint for the ﬁrst batch. For
any batch of paint that uses the same ratio, the amount of yellow paint used will be 
, or 1.5, times the amount of blue paint
used in the batch. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint Anita will use in the second batch will be 1.5 times the amount of blue
paint used in the second batch.
Alternate approach: It’s given that Anita used a ratio of 2 ounces of blue paint to 3 ounces of yellow paint for the ﬁrst batch and
that she will use 5 ounces of blue paint for the second batch. A proportion can be set up to solve for x, the amount of yellow paint
she will use for the second batch: 
. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3 yields 
 , and multiplying both sides
of this equation by x yields 
 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 
 . Since Anita will use 7.5 ounces of
yellow paint for the second batch, this is 
 times the amount of blue paint (5 ounces) used in the second batch.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect and may result from incorrectly interpreting the ratio of blue paint to yellow paint used.
