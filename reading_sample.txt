Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the
number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new
invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood
compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as
species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar
counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of
invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.
B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but
treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of
microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and
colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.
ID: f1bfbed3 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different
counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of
species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly
attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an
additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain
that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in
microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means
that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that
researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal
species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this
information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms
as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations
within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.
Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in
the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The
focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be
accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice
C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and
structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less
sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species
than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different

species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates,
however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other
explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll
and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused
on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the
number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the
difference in the number of species should have been even larger.

A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the
painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of
photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography’s impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although
records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature
portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.
Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?  
A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.
B. Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.
    
C. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed. 
D. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography. 
ID: 87aa7bab Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be "overstated," as some
records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude
that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature’s decline.
Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the "artistic merit" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never suggests
that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought—if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature
started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that portrait painters
shifted to become photographers.

Believing that living in an impractical space can heighten awareness and even improve health, conceptual artists Madeline Gins
and Shusaku Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter is chest-
high on one side and knee-high on the other; a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is disorienting but invigorating: after four
years there, ﬁlmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported signiﬁcant health beneﬁts.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Although inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be rejuvenating,
it is unsustainable.
B. Designing disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically
stimulating environment. 
C. As a ﬁlmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins and Arakawa.
D. Although impractical, the design of the apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may improve the well-being of the building’s
residents. 
ID: d73a908a Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual artists
Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as
uneven kitchen counters and “a door to nowhere.” The text goes on to suggest that there may be beneﬁts to this kind of design
because ﬁlmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health beneﬁts. Thus, although the design
is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building’s residents. 
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn’t address how long
someone can beneﬁcially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained. Choice B is
incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential beneﬁts of living in a home with disorienting design features, it doesn’t suggest
that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment. Choice C is incorrect because the text refers
to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa’s apartment building design may be beneﬁcial, but the text doesn’t
indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists.

One recognized social norm of gift giving is that the time spent obtaining a gift will be viewed as a reﬂection of the gift’s
thoughtfulness. Marketing experts Farnoush Reshadi, Julian Givi, and Gopal Das addressed this view in their studies of norms
speciﬁcally surrounding the giving of gift cards, noting that while recipients tend to view digital gift cards (which can be purchased
online from anywhere and often can be redeemed online as well) as superior to physical gift cards (which sometimes must be
purchased in person and may only be redeemable in person) in terms of usage, 94.8 percent of participants surveyed indicated
that it is more socially acceptable to give a physical gift card to a recipient. This ﬁnding suggests that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. gift givers likely overestimate the amount of effort required to use digital gift cards and thus mistakenly assume gift recipients
will view them as less desirable than physical gift cards.
B. physical gift cards are likely preferred by gift recipients because the tangible nature of those cards offers a greater
psychological sense of ownership than digital gift cards do.
C. physical gift cards are likely less desirable to gift recipients than digital gift cards are because of the perception that physical
gift cards require unnecessary effort to obtain.
D. gift givers likely perceive digital gift cards as requiring relatively low effort to obtain and thus wrongly assume gift recipients
will appreciate them less than they do physical gift cards.
ID: 6b8a7c74 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of perceptions of digital versus physical gift
cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of "the time spent obtaining a gift…as a reﬂection of the gift’s
thoughtfulness" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them
as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift
cards more "socially acceptable" to give. The text speciﬁcally contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards "can be purchased
online from anywhere" with the fact that physical gift cards "sometimes must be purchased in person"—suggesting the greater
diﬃculty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with
the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to
obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable
digital format.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the relative
ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of these factors.
Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable to physical gift
cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of ownership toward
them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the text contrasts the two
formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the diﬃculty involved in acquiring them and discusses how those
factors inﬂuence people’s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the text, which explains that
recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are easier to use than physical cards, not because
physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do. Moreover, the text doesn’t characterize the effort
required to obtain physical gift cards as "unnecessary."

In her 2021 article “Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera,” scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson
(1882–1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson
recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless—indeed, it wasn’t until
1968, after Johnson’s death, that Oxford University’s Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items’ potential
value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. demonstrate the diﬃculties faced by contemporary historians in conducting research at the Bodleian Library without access to
ephemera.
B. represent the challenge of incorporating examples of ephemera into the collections of libraries and other scholarly institutions.
C. lend support to arguments by historians and other researchers who continue to assert that ephemera holds no value for
scholars.
D. illustrate both the relatively low scholarly regard in which ephemera was once held and the later recognition of ephemera’s
possible utility.
ID: d748c3fd Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected “ephemera,” or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his
collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from
disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.
Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson’s large collection
of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that
collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text tells us that “Oxford University’s Bodleian Library acquired
the collection,” but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text
actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson’s collection lends support to arguments that ephemera does hold value
for scholars.

The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011,
transforms its performance space—a ﬁve-story warehouse—into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the
labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront
the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play’s refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense
of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates.
What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More’s use of its performance space? 
A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play’s creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way
that venues from earlier productions could not. 
B. Audience members likely ﬁnd the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through
the entire venue.
C. The production’s dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it diﬃcult to reproduce exactly in a
different theatrical space. 
D. Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play’s
narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.
ID: ed314256 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the production’s use of its large, winding space has a very speciﬁc effect on the
audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be diﬃcult to reproduce the production in a
different space.
Choice A is incorrect. The fact that the venue is in New York City isn’t connected to the experimental nature of the performance.
It’s the size of the venue, not its location in New York, that affects the theatrical experience. Choice B is incorrect. The text never
suggests that audience members are disappointed because they can’t see the entire production. In fact, it suggests that that’s an
important part of the experience. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention a recommended itinerary for audience members.

During the World War II era, some Mexican American women adopted a striking new look called pachuca style. They wore altered
men’s jackets or zoot suits (wide-legged, long-coated suits) and dramatic makeup, and they combed their hair into high, rounded
shapes. Some people criticized pachuca style, saying it was dangerous and women should dress traditionally. But historians see
things differently. They see pachuca style as a form of rebellion against the era’s rigid social expectations for women. They say
that it showed a desire for self-expression and freedom on the part of women who adopted the style.
According to the text, how do historians view pachuca style?
A. They think that pachuca style was such a popular trend that it continues to inﬂuence fashion in the United States to the present
day. 
B. They think that pachuca style was a way for some Mexican American women to express themselves and resist strict social
expectations.
C. They think that pachuca style was celebrated because it enabled some Mexican American women to show their support for
the United States during World War II.
D. They think that pachuca style was similar to other fashion trends that different groups of women adopted in the same period. 
ID: 8c1be131 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view pachuca style that is supported by the
text. The text ﬁrst describes the distinctive pachuca style of dress adopted by some Mexican American women during World War
II, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to contrast this position
with that of historians, who "see things differently": according to these historians, the pachuca style showed a wish for freedom
and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according
to the text, historians think that the pachuca style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social
expectations.
Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly describes the pachuca style as a distinctive look adopted during the World War II
era. It does not indicate that the pachuca style inﬂuences fashion in the United States in the present day. Choice C is incorrect
because the text does not indicate that Mexican American women wore the pachuca style to show support for the United States
during World War II; rather, the style was a means of self-expression and rebellion against social expectations. Choice D is
incorrect because the text does not compare the pachuca style to other fashion trends: the pachuca style is the only style
mentioned.

Utah is home to Pando, a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that all share a single root system. Pando is one of the
largest single organisms by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its growth is declining in part because of grazing by
animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.
According to the text, why are ecologists worried about Pando?
A. It isn’t growing at the same rate it used to.
B. It isn’t producing young trees anymore.
C. It can’t grow into new areas because it is blocked by fences.
D. Its root system can’t support many more new trees.
ID: 92c2564d Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation that is directly stated in the text for why ecologists are worried
about Pando. The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the largest
organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando’s growth is declining, partly because animals are
feeding on the trees. In other words, the ecologists are worried that Pando isn’t growing at the same rate it used to.
Choice B is incorrect. Rather than indicating that Pando isn’t producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed
producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect
because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando’s young trees, not that Pando itself can’t grow
in new areas because it’s blocked by fences. Choice D is incorrect because the text offers no evidence that Pando’s root system is
incapable of supporting new trees or is otherwise a cause of worry for ecologists.

Although many transposons, DNA sequences that move within an organism’s genome through shuﬄing or duplication, have
become corrupted and inactive over time, those from the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) family appear to remain active
in the genomes of some species. In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure that
supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal known for
its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the conﬁrmation of a LINE transposon in Octopus vulgaris and Octopus bimaculoides
genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species’ capacity for advanced cognition.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?
A. The LINE transposon in O. vulgaris and O. bimaculoides genomes is active in an octopus brain structure that functions
similarly to the human hippocampus.
B. The human genome contains multiple transposons from the LINE family that are all primarily active in the hippocampus.
C. A consistent number of copies of LINE transposons is present across the genomes of most octopus species, with few known
corruptions.
D. O. vulgaris and O. bimaculoides have smaller brains than humans do relative to body size, but their genomes contain
sequences from a wider variety of transposon families.
ID: 22e4d633 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. The text says that LINE transposons are important in the human hippocampus, which supports
complex cognition. If the LINE transposon found in octopuses is active in a similar part of their brain, that would suggest that LINE
transposons support complex cognition in octopuses too, which in turn supports the hypothesis that LINE transposons are linked
to advanced cognition in general.
Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how LINE transposons
function in species other than humans. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include
anything about how the LINE transposon in octopuses might support advanced cognition. Choice D is incorrect. This choice
doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how the LINE transposon in octopuses might support advanced
cognition.

To understand how temperature change affects microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, Eva
Kaštovská et al. collected plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to
elevations of 1,700–1,800 meters, where the mean air temperature was warmer by 2°C. Microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling
was accelerated in the transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Kaštovská
et al. to attribute the acceleration to temperature-induced increases in microorganism activity. 
It can most reasonably be inferred from the text that the ﬁnding about the microorganism community composition was important
for which reason?
A. It provided preliminary evidence that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores. 
B. It suggested that temperature-induced changes in microorganism activity may be occurring at increasingly high elevations. 
C. It ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling. 
D. It clariﬁed that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the
community. 
ID: 458b4a11 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the ﬁnding about the microorganism community composition
was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Kaštovská and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one
elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Kaštovská and her
team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that "crucially,
microorganism community composition was unchanged," which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in
microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn’t have been
able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible
explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores,
this is unrelated to what’s important about the ﬁnding that the microorganism composition didn’t change—that it allowed the team
to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in
one core at two different elevations, the text doesn’t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is
incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in
microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.

Jean-Bernard Caron and colleagues recently discovered a cache of jellyﬁsh fossils in the Burgess Shale, a site in the Canadian
Rockies that is rich in fossils from the Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago). Caron and colleagues claim that these are the
oldest jellyﬁsh fossils ever discovered. In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States have yielded fossils of a
similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyﬁsh due to their shapes and the appearance of projecting tentacles. But
Caron and colleagues argue that the apparent tentacles are in fact the comb rows of ctenophores, gelatinous animals that are only
distantly related to jellyﬁsh.
Which statement, if true, would most directly weaken the claim by Caron and colleagues about the fossils found in China and the
United States?
A. Sites in the Canadian Rockies from later periods than the Cambrian period have yielded fossils that have been conclusively
identiﬁed as ctenophore fossils.
B. The fossils found in China and the United States are so poorly preserved that though they cannot be conclusively identiﬁed as
jellyﬁsh, they cannot be conclusively identiﬁed as ctenophores either.
C. While ctenophore fossils have been discovered in China and the United States, they have never been discovered in the Burgess
Shale.
D. The fossils discovered by Caron and colleagues in the Burgess Shale were better preserved than the fossils discovered by
other researchers in China and the United States.
ID: 0d7f4966 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement that, if true, would most directly weaken Caron and colleagues’ claim
that the apparent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils are actually ctenophore comb rows. If the fossils are so poorly
preserved that they cannot be conclusively identiﬁed as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyﬁsh nor, as Caron
claims, that they are ctenophores would be supported.
Choice A is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyﬁsh. These fossils are said to be
"of a similar age" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the
presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils from the US and
China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyﬁsh.
Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether
the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China
are ctenophores, not jellyﬁsh. Although fossil quality is a plausible issue for the research described in the text, nothing in the text
or this choice suggests that the fossils from US and China would have been too poorly preserved for proper identiﬁcation.

advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an
excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a
knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.
According to the text, what is true about Elinor?
A. Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.
B. Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.
C. Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.
D. Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.
ID: 3543e6e2 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it provides a detail about Elinor that is established in the text. The text indicates that
although Elinor is “only nineteen,” she gives good advice and exhibits such a high level of understanding and judgment that she
serves as “the counsellor of her mother.” Thus, Elinor is mature beyond her years.   
Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text says that Elinor advises her mother and often
counteracts her mother’s impulses, there’s no mention of Elinor arguing with her mother or failing to change her mother’s mind.
Choice B is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings, it doesn’t
indicate that she’s excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the
text: there’s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad role model.
Because she’s described as having “an excellent heart,” Elinor likely doesn’t think ill of her mother.

Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement. The table shows that
on day 1, the menu for NASA’s Gemini missions included sugar cookie cubes for meal B.
Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, shrimp cocktail was served on day 4, not day 1; moreover, the item was
served for meal C, not meal B, as this choice claims. Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, hot cocoa was served
on day 3, not on day 1; moreover, the item was served for meal A, not for meal C, as this choice claims. Choice D is incorrect
because according to the table, chicken and vegetables were served on day 2, not on day 1; moreover, the item was served for
meal B, not for meal A, as this choice claims.

Many literary theorists distinguish between fabula, a narrative’s content, and syuzhet, a narrative’s arrangement and presentation
of events. In the ﬁlm The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation of the
story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that fabula and
syuzhet are insuﬃcient to completely describe a narrative—he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena
discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by
two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.
B. Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin claimed that meaning is not inherent in a narrative but is created when an audience
encounters a narrative so that narratives are interpreted differently by different people.
C. The storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II may seem unusually complicated, but they can be easily understood
when two concepts from literary theory are utilized.
D. Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more diﬃcult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented
chronologically.
ID: 1ba5ad7a Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by explaining that many
literary theorists rely on the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement and presentation of
events) and illustrates these concepts by explaining how they can be applied to the ﬁlm The Godfather Part II. The text then
discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that fabula and syuzhet can’t fully describe a narrative, since systematic
categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience
produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully
encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.
Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of
the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text
doesn’t address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently. Choice C is
incorrect. Although the text implies that the storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II are complicated, it discusses the
ﬁlm only to illustrate how the concepts of fabula and syuzhet may be applied to a narrative. The ﬁlm’s storytelling methods aren’t
the primary focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses The Godfather Part II, whose narrative doesn’t adhere to a
single chronological order, only to illustrate the concepts of fabula (a narrative’s content) and syuzhet (a narrative’s arrangement
and presentation of events). The primary focus of this text isn’t the structure of this ﬁlm or of other narratives that are told out of
chronological order; moreover, the text doesn’t consider whether such structures make it harder for audiences to understand
narratives.

Biologists have predicted that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn’t been tested in mountain
environments. Ornithologist Sahas Barve studied feathers from 249 songbird species inhabiting different elevations—and thus
experiencing different temperatures—in the Himalaya Mountains. He found that feathers of high-elevation species not only have a
greater proportion of warming downy sections to ﬂat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation species, but high-
elevation species’ feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Barve’s investigation shows that some species of Himalayan songbirds have evolved feathers that better regulate body
temperature than do the feathers of other species, contradicting previous predictions.
B. Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, lending new
support to a general prediction.
C. Barve discovered that songbirds have adapted to their environment by growing feathers without ﬂat and smooth sections,
complicating an earlier hypothesis.
D. The results of Barve’s study suggest that the ability of birds to withstand cold temperatures is determined more strongly by
feather length than feather structure, challenging an established belief.
ID: 602b47c7 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather
structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat
temperature.
Choice A is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction
described in the ﬁrst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice C is incorrect. Barve’s
study isn’t said to “complicate an earlier hypothesis.” In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the ﬁrst
sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t compare the
importance of feather length and feather structure, and it doesn’t say that Barve’s study challenges any established beliefs. In fact,
the study supports the prediction described in the ﬁrst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat
temperature.

Question ID 068f939b
ID: 068f939b
The ancient Greek concept of “mimesis,” a term used in the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers in discussions
of representational art—visual, performance, or literary art that aims to depict the real world—is a foundational concept of the
Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically translated as “imitation” in modern editions of ancient Greek texts, but
scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: “imitation” implies that art merely copies—and is thus by deﬁnition
entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating “mimesis” thusly obscures the
multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.
Which statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text?
A. One of the earliest appearances of mimesis’s root word, mimos, can be found in an ancient Greek tragedy in reference to
dramatic impersonation, and the mim- root came to be generally associated with the musical and poetic arts by the ﬁfth
century BCE.
B. Both Plato’s and Aristotle’s theorizations of mimesis examine the psychological effects that works of art induce in the viewer
or listener.
C. Although several of Plato’s earliest philosophical works discuss aesthetic ideas, the term “mimesis” doesn’t appear in Plato’s
discussions of art until Cratylus, a relatively late work.
D. Although Plato’s writings typically characterize representational art as an inferior reﬂection of the physical world, Aristotle
suggests that mimesis can refer to art’s capacity to envision hypothetical conditions that could, but don’t yet, exist.
ID: 068f939b Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement that would support Halliwell’s claim that "imitation" is an overly
simpliﬁed translation of the word "mimesis" in the context of ancient Greek philosophical discussions of representational art and
that, because it suggests a view of art as merely copying things that exist in reality, the translation obscures the fact that Plato,
Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality in varied ways. If Plato’s works tend to treat
representational art as an inferior or inadequate reﬂection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while
Aristotle’s works suggest that the term "mimesis" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t currently exist but could
exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term "mimesis" means more than
just "imitation" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality.
Choice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos ﬁrst being used in drama and the root mim- coming to be
associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the speciﬁc term "mimesis" as it was used by
ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim
that a common translation of the speciﬁc term is an oversimpliﬁcation. Choice B is incorrect because the issue of art’s
psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is related to reality, so the
idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t have any bearing on
Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimpliﬁes the relationship between art and reality. Further, this idea
would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell
claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that Plato discussed
aesthetics in his early works but didn’t use the term "mimesis" until later doesn’t give any indication of how Plato or any other
ancient Greek philosophers understood the relation between art and reality, so it would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a

High levels of public uncertainty about which economic policies a country will adopt can make planning diﬃcult for businesses,
but measures of such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo analyzed
trends in news reports to derive measures not only for general economic policy uncertainty but also for uncertainty related to
speciﬁc areas of economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One revelation of her work is that a general measure may not fully reﬂect
uncertainty about speciﬁc areas of policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where general economic policy uncertainty ______

Choice D is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively illustrate the text’s claim about general economic
policy uncertainty in the United Kingdom. The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending
policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general
economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy
speciﬁcally (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120)
was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between
these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reﬂect uncertainty about speciﬁc areas of
policy.
Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that the level of general economic policy uncertainty was similar to the level of
uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in both 2005 (with values of approximately 90 and 100, respectively) and 2009
(with values of approximately 80 and 75, respectively). Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic
policy uncertainty was higher than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2006, 2007, and 2009, not that it was lower
each year from 2005 to 2010. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty reached its
highest level in 2010, which was when uncertainty about tax and public spending policy also reached its highest level, not its
lowest level.

Fish whose DNA has been modiﬁed to include genetic material from other species are known as transgenic. Some transgenic ﬁsh
have genes from jellyﬁsh that result in ﬂuorescence (that is, they glow in the dark). Although these ﬁsh were initially engineered for
research purposes in the 1990s, they were sold as pets in the 2000s and can now be found in the wild in creeks in Brazil. A student
in a biology seminar who is writing a paper on these ﬁsh asserts that their escape from Brazilian ﬁsh farms into the wild may have
signiﬁcant negative long-term ecological effects.
Which quotation from a researcher would best support the student’s assertion?
A. “In one site in the wild where transgenic ﬁsh were observed, females outnumbered males, while in another the numbers of
females and males were equivalent.”
B. “Though some presence of transgenic ﬁsh in the wild has been recorded, there are insuﬃcient studies of the impact of those
ﬁsh on the ecosystems into which they are introduced.”
C. “The ecosystems into which transgenic ﬁsh are known to have been introduced may represent a subset of the ecosystems into
which the ﬁsh have actually been introduced.”
D. “Through interbreeding, transgenic ﬁsh might introduce the trait of ﬂuorescence into wild ﬁsh populations, making those
populations more vulnerable to predators.”
ID: 29f5c8c2 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would best support the student’s assertion that the escape of transgenic ﬁsh
from Brazilian ﬁsh farms into the wild may have signiﬁcant negative long-term ecological effects. The text explains that transgenic
ﬁsh have DNA that includes genetic material from other species, that some transgenic ﬁsh have genes from jellyﬁsh that make
them glow in the dark, and that glow-in-the-dark transgenic ﬁsh can now be found in the wild in Brazilian creeks. The quotation
indicates why the escape of these ﬁsh may have negative long-term ecological effects: glow-in-the-dark transgenic ﬁsh might
introduce ﬂuorescence into wild ﬁsh populations by breeding with wild ﬁsh, causing wild ﬁsh to glow in the dark and thereby
allowing predators to prey on them much more easily.
Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t mention any negative effects of the introduction of ﬂuorescent transgenic
ﬁsh into the wild. The quotation merely compares the ratio of females to males at two sites in the wild where transgenic ﬁsh have
been observed. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t support the idea that the escape of ﬂuorescent transgenic
ﬁsh from Brazilian ﬁsh farms may have signiﬁcant negative long-term ecological effects. Rather, the quotation suggests that more
research is needed to understand the effects. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation supports the idea that transgenic ﬁsh
may be present in more ecosystems than has been observed; it doesn’t address whether the presence of ﬂuorescent transgenic
ﬁsh affects these ecosystems.

B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text’s discussion of lizard species’ use of
maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires
so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays
data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph
categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%–39% of maximal speed, 40%–49% of

speed, and 90%–100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent
categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%–59%, 60%–69%, 70%–79%, and 80%–89%. Thus, the data in the
graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.
Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn’t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal
speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species.
Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed
while escaping predators is 90%–100% (8 species total). However, these data don’t complete the text, which is concerned instead
with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy
required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and
therefore don’t complete the text’s discussion of lizard species’ use of maximal speed when escaping predators.

amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992,
meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reﬂect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006
reﬂect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again
from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and
colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was beneﬁcial for grass plants but not for trees—grass cover increased signiﬁcantly after the
dam was built, while forest cover declined. 
Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters
and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle
Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in
grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of
data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass
cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reﬂects data from the graph when it compares
grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to
changes that beneﬁted grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the
dam might indicate that the dam beneﬁted grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three
years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to beneﬁt trees.

The practice of logging (cutting down trees for commercial and other uses) is often thought to be at odds with forest conservation
(the work of preserving forests). However, a massive study in forest management and preservation spanning 700,000 hectares in
Oregon’s Malheur National Forest calls that view into question. So far, results of the study suggest that forest plots that have
undergone limited logging (the careful removal of a controlled number of trees) may be more robust than plots that haven’t been
logged at all. These results, in turn, suggest that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. logging may be useful for maintaining healthy forests, provided it is limited.
B. other forest management strategies are more effective than limited logging.
C. as time passes, it will be diﬃcult to know whether limited logging has any beneﬁts.
D. the best way to support forest health may be to leave large forests entirely untouched.
ID: ca5a3fb4 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the potential effects of logging on forest
conservation. The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation
efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on speciﬁc forest
plots, ﬁnding that the plots with limited logging may be "more robust" (healthier) than the plots that hadn’t been logged at all. Given
these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.
Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest
management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest
conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more
successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with ﬁndings that speciﬁc plots
of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard
to know whether limited logging might be beneﬁcial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation
efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with
limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather
presents a research study with ﬁndings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.

Almost all works of ﬁction contain references to the progression of time, including the time of day when events in a story take
place. In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reﬂects a
shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this
conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and
tally both speciﬁc time references—that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.—and implied ones, such as mentions of
meals typically associated with a particular time of day.
Which ﬁnding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?
A. Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800
do.
B. Novels published after 1880 contain signiﬁcantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from

the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain signiﬁcantly more references to activities occurring after 10
p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the
availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting—which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light—
many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in
such references after 1880 would align with the researchers’ conclusion, reﬂecting an increase in late-night activities made
possible by electric lighting.
Choice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers’
conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time
of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be
clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative
to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support
the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the
researchers’ conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If
references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this
would reﬂect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers’ conclusion
involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting.

When fashion designer Lloyd Henri Kiva New opened his store in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1945, he quickly became known for
creating delicately crafted leather goods, like belts and hats. He was perhaps most renowned for his colorful handbags, which he
made by hand using a long and painstaking process. As he gained more customers, New began using sewing machines and other
tools to help him produce bags more eﬃciently, though he continued to handcraft the crucial details that made each bag unique.
Based on the text, what would have been the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines?
A. He would have been unable to ensure that each bag included unique, handcrafted details.
B. He would have struggled to meet the increasing demand for his bags.
C. He would have had to individually design each bag he produced.
D. He would not have been able to generate as much interest in his bags.
ID: cf956802 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines. The
text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more eﬃciently, or in less time
than he could when sewing by hand. It’s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn’t reduced the time it took to make each bag by
starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand.
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using
sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that
individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing
unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice
D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New’s bags before he started using sewing
machines. Rather than allowing New to generate more interest in his bags, sewing machines helped New keep up with the interest
that had already grown.

The only ﬂowering plant species native to Antarctica, Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica grow in places where the
earth remains free of ice for much of the year. Botanist Niccoletta Cannone wondered how the warming of Antarctica’s climate in
recent years had affected these species, so she visited a site in Antarctica, ﬁrst in 2009 and later in 2018, to count the number of
plants growing there. Cannone found that the area of land covered by the two species had signiﬁcantly expanded during the nine-
year period. While both species likely beneﬁted from warming temperatures, Colobanthus quitensis ______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison?
A. suppressed the growth of Deschampsia antarctica, which covered a smaller area of land in 2018 than it had in 2009.
B. saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did, increasing the area of land it covered by more than half.
C. showed a greater increase in the average size of individual plants than Deschampsia antarctica did.
D. covered land newly freed from ice at a rate 55% faster than that of Deschampsia antarctica.
ID: 95388117 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the comparison of how Colobanthus
quitensis beneﬁted from warming temperatures with how Deschampsia antarctica beneﬁted from them. The table shows the land
area covered by these two plant species at a site in Antarctica. According to the table, Colobanthus quitensis increased the area it
covered by 55% from 2009 to 2018, whereas Deschampsia antarctica increased the area it covered by 28% during the same period.
It therefore follows that Colobanthus quitensis saw a greater expansion than Deschampsia antarctica did and that Colobanthus
quitensis increased the area of land it covered by more than half.
Choice A is incorrect because according to the table, Deschampsia antarctica covered 1,230 square meters of land in 2009 and
1,576 square meters of land in 2018. Deschampsia antarctica therefore covered a larger, not a smaller, area of land in 2018 than in
2009. Moreover, there’s no information in the text or the table that suggests that one species of the plant suppressed the other.
Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the table. The table shows the land area covered by
Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from 2009 to
2018, not the average size of individual plants belonging to the two species. The data in the table therefore can’t be used to make
a comparison of the increase in individual plants’ average size. Choice D is incorrect because the table shows the land area
covered by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica and the percent increase in area covered by the two species from
2009 to 2018, not the rate at which the species increased the area they covered. Moreover, there’s nothing in the table or the text
that suggests that the areas covered by the two species were newly freed from ice.

Correct Answer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his
colleagues’ ﬁndings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the
percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers
mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in
other words, most of those farmers are female, which exempliﬁes the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than
half) of the farmers cultivating speciﬁc types of crops in some regions.
Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers
mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers
mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows
that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%,
respectively). Additionally, it doesn’t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don’t make
up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t
effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly
cultivate cereals, which doesn’t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn’t show that a majority (more than half) of the
farmers cultivating certain crops are female.

Ochre sea stars live in tidal pools along the shoreline of the Paciﬁc Ocean. At night, they move to higher shore levels in search of
prey. But scientists Corey Garza and Carlos Robles noticed that ochre sea stars stayed at lower levels at night after heavy rains.
Garza and Robles hypothesized that a layer of fresh water formed by rainfall was a barrier to the sea stars. To test their
hypothesis, the scientists did an experiment. They placed some sea stars in a climbable tank of seawater and other sea stars in a
similar tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. Then, the scientists watched the sea stars’ behavior at night. 
Which ﬁnding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis?
A. None of the sea stars climbed to the tops of the tanks, but sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom
of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did.
B. Sea stars in the tank with only seawater climbed to the top of the tank, but sea stars in the other tank stopped climbing just
below the layer of fresh water.
C. Both groups of sea stars climbed to the tops of the tanks, but sea stars in the tank with only seawater climbed more slowly
than sea stars in the other tank did.
D. Sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank, but sea stars in the other tank climbed into
the layer of fresh water.
ID: 3091f805 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a ﬁnding that, if true, would support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis that a layer of
fresh water forms a barrier to ochre sea stars. The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in
search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in
a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don’t cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and
Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If
the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other
tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles’s
hypothesis.
Choice A is incorrect because ﬁnding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more
than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and
Robles’s hypothesis. Such a ﬁnding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is
incorrect because ﬁnding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles’s
hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn’t a barrier to the sea stars. Choice D is incorrect because
ﬁnding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank but sea stars in the other tank
climbed into the layer of fresh water wouldn’t support Garza and Robles’s hypothesis. Instead, such a ﬁnding would suggest that
the layer of fresh water wasn’t a barrier to the sea stars, thereby weakening Garza and Robles’s hypothesis.

While attending school in New York City in the 1980s, Okwui Enwezor encountered few works by African artists in exhibitions,
despite New York’s reputation as one of the best places to view contemporary art from around the world. According to an arts
journalist, later in his career as a renowned curator and art historian, Enwezor sought to remedy this deﬁciency, not by focusing
solely on modern African artists, but by showing how their work ﬁts into the larger context of global modern art and art history.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly support the journalist’s claim?
A. As curator of the Haus der Kunst in Munich, Germany, Enwezor organized a retrospective of Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui’s
work entitled El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale, one of the largest art exhibitions devoted to a Black artist in Europe’s history. 
B. In the exhibition Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965, Enwezor and cocurator Katy Siegel brought
works by African artists such as Malangatana Ngwenya together with pieces by major ﬁgures from other countries, like US
artist Andy Warhol and Mexico’s David Siqueiros.
C. Enwezor’s work as curator of the 2001 exhibition The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945–
1994 showed how African movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War
profoundly inﬂuenced work by African artists of the period, such as Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq and Thomas Mukarobgwa.
D. Enwezor organized the exhibition In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present not to emphasize a particular aesthetic
trend but to demonstrate the broad range of ways in which African artists have approached the medium of photography.
ID: 94c54577 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most directly support the arts journalist’s claim about
Enwezor’s work as a curator and art historian. In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on
modern African artists but also to show “how their work ﬁts into the larger context of global modern art and art history,” or how
their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art
Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel’s exhibition brought works by African artists
together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor sought to show works
by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history.
Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to
show how works by modern African artists ﬁt into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of El
Anatsui: Triumphant Scale indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The
description doesn’t suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui’s works ﬁt into a global artistic context. Choice C is
incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how
works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of The Short
Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945–1994 indicates that the exhibition showed how African artists
were inﬂuenced by movements for independence from European colonial powers following the Second World War. Although this
suggests that Enwezor intended the exhibition to place works by African artists in a political context, it doesn’t indicate that the
works were placed in a global artistic context. Choice D is incorrect because it describes an exhibition that wouldn’t support the
arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists relate to the larger context of global
modern art and art history. The description of In/sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present indicates that the exhibition
was intended to reveal the broad range of approaches taken by African photographers, not that the exhibition showed how
photography by African artists ﬁts into a global artistic context.

Researchers recently found that disruptions to an enjoyable experience, like a short series of advertisements during a television
show, often increase viewers’ reported enjoyment. Suspecting that disruptions to an unpleasant experience would have the
opposite effect, the researchers had participants listen to construction noise for 30 minutes and anticipated that those whose
listening experience was frequently interrupted with short breaks of silence would thus ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. ﬁnd the disruptions more irritating as time went on. 
B. rate the listening experience as more negative than those whose listening experience was uninterrupted.
C. rate the experience of listening to construction noise as lasting for less time than it actually lasted.
D. perceive the volume of the construction noise as growing softer over time.
ID: ce4448b7 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. It most logically completes the text. The text tells us that disruptions to an enjoyable experience
increase viewers’ enjoyment. It also says that researchers suspect the opposite is true for disruptions to an unpleasant
experience. Thus, we can infer that the researchers expect to ﬁnd that the interrupted unpleasant experience was worse for
listeners than the uninterrupted unpleasant experience.  
Choice A is incorrect. It doesn’t logically complete the text. The text never makes any claims about how irritating the disruptions
themselves are perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions,
and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences. Choice C is incorrect. It doesn’t logically complete the
text. The text never makes any claims about how long any experience is perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant
experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant
experiences. Choice D is incorrect. It doesn’t logically complete the text. The text never makes any claims about how interruptions
affect the perceived volume of the unpleasant or pleasant experience. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are
perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences.

Male túngara frogs make complex calls to attract mates, but their calls also attract frog-biting midges, insects that feed on the
frogs’ blood. Researchers Ximena Bernal and Priyanka de Silva wondered if the calls alone are suﬃcient for midges to locate the
frogs or if midges use carbon dioxide emitted by frogs as an additional cue to their prey’s whereabouts, like mosquitoes do. In an
experiment, the researchers placed two midge traps in a túngara frog breeding area. One trap played recordings of túngara frog
calls and the other released carbon dioxide along with playing the calls. Bernal and de Silva concluded that carbon dioxide does
not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.
Which ﬁnding from the experiment, if true, would most directly support Bernal and de Silva’s conclusion?
A. Only a small number of midges were found in the traps, though the majority were found in the trap that played calls and
released carbon dioxide.
B. Midges entered the trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls only during or immediately after periods of carbon
dioxide release. 
C. More midges were found in the trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide. 
D. The trap that released carbon dioxide and played calls attracted few midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were low but
attracted many midges when carbon dioxide concentrations were high.
ID: 60c6b64d Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it presents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion that
carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges regarding the location of male túngara frogs. The text
begins by stating that the mating call of the male túngara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs’ blood.
Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were suﬃcient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if
midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used
to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the
midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers’ trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and
released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem suﬃcient without the carbon dioxide cue. This ﬁnding supports the
researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.
Choice A is incorrect because ﬁnding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating
call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers’ conclusion—that carbon dioxide
does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of túngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect
because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon
dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a ﬁnding that
would contradict the researchers’ conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect
because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide
concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a
ﬁnding contrary to the researchers’ conclusion.

“Loon Point” is a 1912 poem by Amy Lowell. In the poem, which presents a nighttime scene on a body of water, Lowell describes
an element of nature as an active participant in the experience, writing, ______
Which quotation from “Loon Point” most effectively illustrates the claim?
A. “Through the water the moon writes her legends / In light, on the smooth, wet sand.”
B. “Softly the water ripples / Against the canoe’s curving side.”
C. “Or like the snow-white petals / Which drop from an overblown rose.”
D. “But the moon in her wayward beauty / Is ever and always the same.”
ID: 1f3be847 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Lowell describes an element of nature as an
active participant in the experience of a nighttime scene on a body of water. The quotation presents the image of the moon
shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reﬂects through the
water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In
other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene.
Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines
—the waves—isn’t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as
waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t present a nighttime scene on a body of water;
instead, it describes petals falling from a rose. Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation presents an image of an element of
nature—the moon—it doesn’t mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but
instead as static or unchanging (“ever and always the same”).

Purine 0.2 0.02 not detected
Xanthine 39 3 1
Adenine 15 1 40
Hypoxanthine 24 1 2
Employing high-performance liquid chromatography—a process that uses pressurized water to separate material into its
component molecules—astrochemist Yashiro Oba and colleagues analyzed two samples of the Murchison meteorite that landed
in Australia as well as soil from the landing zone of the meteorite to determine the concentrations of various organic molecules.
By comparing the relative concentrations of types of molecules known as nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite with those in
the soil, the team concluded that there is evidence that the nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite formed in space and are not
the result of contamination on Earth.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support the team’s conclusion?
A. Isoguanine and purine were detected in both meteorite samples but not in the soil sample.
B. Adenine and xanthine were detected in both of the meteorite samples and in the soil sample.
C. Hypoxanthine and purine were detected in both the Murchison meteorite sample 2 and in the soil sample.
D. Isoguanine and hypoxanthine were detected in the Murchison meteorite sample 1 but not in sample 2.
ID: 7a1877be Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination.
Presence of nucleobases in the meteorite and not in soil provides evidence that those nucleobases likely didn’t come from the
soil.
Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the conclusion. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases
weren’t the result of soil contamination. If the nucleobases are present in both the soil and meteorite, then it’s possible that these
nucleobases came from the soil. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Purine was not detected in the soil sample.
Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Both isoguanine and hypoxanthine were detected in both Murchison
meteorite samples.

Paleontologists searching for signs of ancient life have found many fossilized specimens of prehistoric human ancestors,
including several from the Pleistocene era discovered in a geological formation in the Minatogawa quarry in Japan. However, to
study the emergence of the earliest multicellular organisms to appear on Earth, researchers must turn elsewhere, such as to the
Ediacaran geological formation at Mistaken Point in Canada. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 146-hectare reserve contains
more than 10,000 fossils that together document a critical moment in evolutionary history.
What does the text indicate about the geological formation at Mistaken Point? 
A. It holds a greater number of fossils but from a smaller variety of species than the formation in the Minatogawa quarry does.
B. It has provided evidence that the earliest human species may have emerged before the Pleistocene era.

organisms,” which implies that these fossils are from an older time period than the fossils of “prehistoric human ancestors” found
in the Minatogawa quarry.
Choice A is incorrect. The text says that the formation at Mistake Point contains “more than 10,000 fossils,” but it doesn’t compare
this number to the number of fossils in the Minatogawa quarry. It also doesn’t say anything about the variety of species in either
formation. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of “the earliest multicellular
organisms,” but it never says that the site contains early human fossils too. Rather, the early human fossils mentioned in the text
were found in the formation at Minatogawa quarry. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the fossils at Mistaken Point
“document a critical moment in evolutionary history,” but it never says that Mistaken Point is the most valuable source of
information about prehistoric life forms.

A student is conducting an experiment to test the effect of temperature and ethylene treatment on the ripening speed of bananas.
The student treated some bananas with ethylene while leaving others untreated, then allowed both types of bananas to ripen at
one of four different temperatures. Comparing the data for bananas with and without ethylene, the student concluded that ______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion?
A. 20°C is the ideal temperature at which to store bananas to slow ripening time. 
B. for those bananas that were not treated with ethylene, differences in temperature were not associated with absolute
differences in ripening time.
C. bananas treated with ethylene ripen faster at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C.
D. ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C.
ID: 040583a5 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about
banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap between the two
bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2 gridlines (from about 4
days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph shows that at 14°C, 16°C, and

18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated bananas to about 11 days for
untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for untreated bananas at 16°C; and from
about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C). Since the gap between the bars at each of
these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps is larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it
can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at
20°C.
Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than ethylene-
treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C,
respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at the other
temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The information in
the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas at the other
temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that as
temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C to about 5.5 days at 20°C,
with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were associated with absolute
differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature and differences in ripening
time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 14°C and 16°C were about
8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which
were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and
16°C than at 18°C and 20°C.

In a study by Mika R. Moran, Daniel A. Rodriguez, and colleagues, residents of Quito, Ecuador, and Lima, Peru, were surveyed about
parks in their cities. Of the 618 respondents from Quito, 82.9% indicated that they use the city’s parks, and of the 663 respondents
from Lima, 72.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of Quito respondents who reported living within a 10-
minute walk of a park was much lower than that reported by Lima respondents, greater proximity alone can’t explain the difference
in park use.
The text makes which point about the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks?
A. It was much larger than the researchers conducting the study expected.
B. It is caused by something other than the parks’ proximity to city residents.
C. It could be due to inaccuracies in the survey results.
D. It was calculated using sources that predate the survey. 
ID: 2312021b Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the difference between the proportions of Quito residents and
Lima residents using parks that is supported by the text. The text states that 82.9% of surveyed Quito residents and 72.7% of
surveyed Lima residents reported using their city’s parks. The text then notes that compared to Lima respondents, a much smaller
percentage of Quito respondents said they live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text concludes that because a greater
proportion of Quito respondents used parks despite generally living farther from them than Lima respondents did, "greater
proximity"—being closer to a park—"can’t explain the difference in park use." That is, the text makes the point that the difference
between the proportions of Quito residents and Lima residents using parks is caused by something other than the distance of the
parks from city residents.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether the researchers had expected a particular result and doesn’t
indicate that they were surprised by the difference in park usage between the two cities’ residents. The text simply presents the
survey ﬁndings without stating the researchers’ expectations. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that there
might be inaccuracies in the survey results; the text presents the ﬁndings as factual information and uses them as the basis for a
conclusion that a certain factor doesn’t explain differences in park usage between Quito and Lima residents. Choice D is incorrect
because the text doesn’t mention any sources that predate the survey or suggest that the difference in proportions was calculated
using such sources. According to the text, the information about park usage came directly from the survey of residents in Quito
and Lima.

The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyri’s 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight-year-old Heidi
and her friend’s grandmother are looking at some illustrated books.
Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was
showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful ﬂock grazing on a green pasture. In
the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With
glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Heidi is upset until she sees a serene image of a pasture in one of Grandmama’s books.
B. Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books.
C. Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama’s books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.
D. Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama’s books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before.
ID: 57485f5e Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and
fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon ﬁrst seeing the picture of the
green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image
that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,”
suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these
descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book.
Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the
green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the
book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon ﬁrst seeing
the image, the text’s description of the image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear.
The text describes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather
than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image of
the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it’s
unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is
delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep.

Many of William Shakespeare’s tragedies address broad themes that still appeal to today’s audiences. For instance, Romeo and
Juliet, which is set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time, tackles the themes of parents versus children and love versus hate, and the
play continues to be read and produced widely around the world. But understanding Shakespeare’s so-called history plays can
require a knowledge of several centuries of English history. Consequently, ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. many theatergoers and readers today are likely to ﬁnd Shakespeare’s history plays less engaging than the tragedies.
B. some of Shakespeare’s tragedies are more relevant to today’s audiences than twentieth-century plays.
C. Romeo and Juliet is the most thematically accessible of all Shakespeare’s tragedies.
D. experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare’s history plays to his other works.
ID: a68fd3e7 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the relative appeal of different kinds of
plays by Shakespeare to today’s audiences. According to the text, Shakespeare’s tragedies address broad themes that continue to
appeal to today’s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and
Juliet, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time. In contrast, the
text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand
Shakespeare’s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge,
it follows that they are likely to ﬁnd Shakespeare’s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies.
Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare’s tragedies and twentieth-century
plays, only between Shakespeare’s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren’t mentioned, there’s no basis
in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare’s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today’s audiences.
Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today’s audiences, it doesn’t
suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare’s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet
as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare’s tragedies hold continued appeal for today’s readers and theatergoers.
Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand
Shakespeare’s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than
Shakespeare’s other works.

Three Studies' Estimated Average Velocity of LMC
Researchers Study yearEstimated average velocity
Murai and Fujimoto 1980 344 km/s
Kallivayalil and colleagues2006 378 km/s
Gardiner and colleagues1994 297 km/s
In 2006, Nitya Kallivayalil and colleagues calculated the most accurate estimate yet of the average velocity (in kilometers per
second) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy. Before the 2006 study, estimates of the average velocity were low enough
for the LMC to maintain an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy, but according to an analysis by Gurtina Besla and colleagues, the
estimated velocity from the 2006 study is too high for the LMC to maintain such an orbit. Therefore, if Besla and colleagues are
correct, the maximum average velocity for the LMC that would allow it to maintain orbit around the Milky Way is likely ______
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A. above 344 km/s but below 378 km/s.
B. above 297 km/s but below 344 km/s.
C. above 378 km/s.
D. below 297 km/s.
ID: bc7b1a04 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to give the range of velocities for the LMC from the 1980 value
(344 km/s) to the 2006 value (378 km/s), thereby effectively completing the text. The text indicates that before 2006, all the
estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates
that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that
if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s)
is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below
378 km/s.
Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the ﬁrst estimate that
exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate
of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that
Besla and colleagues’ analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit
around the Milky Way. Therefore, if a velocity of 378 km/s is too high, an even higher velocity will also be too high. Choice D is
incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the ﬁrst to exceed the velocity range
required to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible
orbital velocity for the LMC.

Question ID 3d91c973

Mosasaurs were large marine reptiles that lived in the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million to 66 million years ago.
Celina Suarez, Alberto Pérez-Huerta, and T. Lynn Harrell Jr. examined oxygen-18 isotopes in mosasaur tooth enamel in order to
calculate likely mosasaur body temperatures and determined that mosasaurs were endothermic—that is, they used internal
metabolic processes to maintain a stable body temperature in a variety of ambient temperatures. Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and
Harrell claim that endothermy would have enabled mosasaurs to include relatively cold polar waters in their range.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s claim?
A. Mosasaurs’ likely body temperatures are easier to determine from tooth enamel oxygen-18 isotope data than the body
temperatures of nonendothermic Late Cretaceous marine reptiles are.
B. Fossils of both mosasaurs and nonendothermic marine reptiles have been found in roughly equal numbers in regions known to
be near the poles during the Late Cretaceous, though in lower concentrations than elsewhere.
C. Several mosasaur fossils have been found in regions known to be near the poles during the Late Cretaceous, while relatively
few fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles have been found in those locations. 
D. During the Late Cretaceous, seawater temperatures were likely higher throughout mosasaurs’ range, including near the poles,
than seawater temperatures at those same latitudes are today. 
ID: 3d91c973 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it presents the ﬁnding that, if true, would best support Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s
claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to
conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still
maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters
near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs
were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers’ claim: it
would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that
endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range.
Choice A is incorrect because ﬁnding that it’s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is
to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim. Whether one research process is
more diﬃcult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where
mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.   Choice B is incorrect because ﬁnding roughly equal numbers
of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest
that endothermy didn’t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold
polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers’ claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because ﬁnding that the
temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn’t weaken the researchers’ claim.
Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be
advantageous to mosasaurs, so this ﬁnding wouldn’t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers’
claim.

Question ID 11c68ded

A contraction of “you all,” the pronoun “y’all” has long been used as a plural version of “you” in the South and in Black communities
around the US. In recent decades, most other English-speaking communities in the US have begun to use “y’all.” What explains its
rise in popularity? Many varieties of English have no pronoun that speciﬁcally addresses more than one person and instead must
use “you” to address both one person and more than one. But “y’all” always refers to two or more people. As a result, it conveys
the speaker’s meaning more precisely than “you” can.
Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?
A. How many other plural versions of the pronoun “you” are there in English, besides “y’all”?
B. Why has the pronoun “y’all” become more widely used in the US?
C. When was the ﬁrst recorded use of the pronoun “y’all” in the English language?
D. Is “y’all” commonly used in English-speaking regions of the world besides the US?
ID: 11c68ded Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it presents a question that the text is attempting to answer: why has the pronoun "y’all"
become more widely used in the US? The text begins by explaining where and how the plural pronoun "y’all" originated and then
goes on to state that its use has been rising in popularity, even in areas outside of its place of origin. The text then attributes this
rise in popularity to the fact that many varieties of English do not have a pronoun to address more than one person, and thus "you"
must function as both a singular and plural pronoun.
Choice A is incorrect because while the text states that "y’all" is used as a plural of "you" in English, it does not discuss other plural
forms of the word. Choice C is incorrect because while the text discusses the general origins of the pronoun "y’all," it does not
state when the use of the pronoun was ﬁrst recorded in the English language. Choice D is incorrect because though the text
addresses the use of the pronoun "y’all" within English-speaking communities in the US, it does not address its use outside of that
geographic area.

ID: 7cbb9764 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it presents a quotation about Elizabeth Catlett that supports the student’s claim that this
artist had a talent for unifying various traditions and styles in her work. The quotation explains that to create the work, Catlett
combined Indigenous sculpture with the visual aesthetic of modern muralists from Mexico as well as that of German artist Kathe
Kollwitz. In other words, Catlett was able to unify several artistic traditions and styles within a single sculpture.
Choice B is incorrect because in discussing the technique and subject matter of Catlett’s collage, the quotation makes no
reference to particular traditions or styles. Choice C is incorrect because in describing the sculpture, the quotation doesn’t mention
any artistic traditions or styles that Catlett may have synthesized to create the work. Choice D is incorrect because in discussing
Catlett’s prints of notable African American women, the quotation doesn’t characterize those prints as having fused different
traditions or styles.

A student is examining a long, challenging poem that was initially published in a quarterly journal without explanatory notes, then
later republished in a stand-alone volume containing only that poem and accompanying explanatory notes written by the poet. The
student asserts that the explanatory notes were included in the republication primarily as a marketing device to help sell the stand-
alone volume.
Which statement, if true, would most directly support the student’s claim?
A. The text of the poem as published in the quarterly journal is not identical to the text of the poem published in the stand-alone
volume.
B. Many critics believe that the poet’s explanatory notes remove certain ambiguities of the poem and make it less interesting as a
result.
C. The publishers of the stand-alone volume requested the explanatory notes from the poet in order to make the book attractive
to readers who already had a copy of the poem in a journal issue.
D. Correspondence between the poet and the publisher reveals that the poet’s explanatory notes went through several drafts.
ID: 94ca8ebd Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it would most directly support the student’s claim about the motivation for including
explanatory notes with the stand-alone volume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had previously been published
without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem
would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that
volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the
author’s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the
notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student’s
claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device.
Choice A is incorrect because the student’s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone
volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never
suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student’s claim is about why the explanatory notes
were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers’ and critics’ subsequent experience of the
poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn’t directly
address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would
support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes speciﬁcally to make them useful to the marketing of the
stand-alone volume.

The Mammillaria cactus M. boolii occurs naturally only in the state of Sonora in Mexico, and the smallness of its range makes it
especially vulnerable to extinction. The traditional single-species approach to conservation emphasizes the need to focus on
individual species most at risk, like M. boolii, but recently, conservationists have argued that an ecosystem-based approach that
incorporates the many interactions between the climate, terrain, and various species of a given geographical area may lead to
better outcomes for all the species in a given location. If this view is correct, the single-species approach to the conservation of M.
boolii could thus ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. lead to a better understanding of how the distribution of Mammillaria species throughout Mexico has affected their survival.
B. allow conservationists to better consider how climatic changes affecting Sonora may reduce the number of species
competing with M. boolii.
C. erroneously shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself.
D. fail to consider the ways in which the survival of M. boolii may be inﬂuenced by changes in the populations of other species
that inhabit Sonora.
ID: 4b3d6062 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of conservation approaches for the
Mammillaria cactus M. boolii. The text establishes that M. boolii only grows naturally in the state of Sonora in Mexico, which
makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The text then contrasts two approaches to conservation: the traditional single-
species approach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based approach that considers the
interactions between climate, terrain, and various species in a geographical area. According to the text, conservationists have
recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem
view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the cactus’s survival
depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora’s ecosystem.
Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout
Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses speciﬁcally on M. boolii in Sonora and different
approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora would
reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this speciﬁc dynamic. In fact, the text
implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn’t specify how climatic
changes might affect competition between species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the single-species
approach would shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. boolii itself—rather, it suggests that this approach might be
too narrowly focused on M. boolii alone without considering the broader ecosystem-related factors that affect its survival.

Question ID 66c47028
ID: 66c47028
In 1934 physicist Eugene Wigner posited the existence of a crystal consisting entirely of electrons in a honeycomb-like structure.
The so-called Wigner crystal remained largely conjecture, however, until Feng Wang and colleagues announced in 2021 that they
had captured an image of one. The researchers trapped electrons between two semiconductors and then cooled the apparatus,
causing the electrons to settle into a crystalline structure. By inserting an ultrathin sheet of graphene above the crystal, the
researchers obtained an impression—the ﬁrst visual conﬁrmation of the Wigner crystal.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Researchers have obtained the most deﬁnitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.
B. Researchers have identiﬁed an innovative new method for working with unusual crystalline structures.
C. Graphene is the most important of the components required to capture an image of a Wigner crystal.
D.  It’s diﬃcult to acquire an image of a Wigner crystal because of the crystal’s honeycomb structure.
ID: 66c47028 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, Eugene Wigner
hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on
to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconﬁrmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an
impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have
obtained the most deﬁnitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal.
Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal—the Wigner crystal— and doesn’t discuss crystalline
structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues ﬁgured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner
crystal, it doesn’t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text
describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn’t address
the relative importance of each component in that process. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t state that researchers
had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why
it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it.

O Pioneers! is a 1913 novel by Willa Cather. In the novel, Cather portrays Alexandra Bergson as having a deep emotional
connection to her natural surroundings: ______
Which quotation from O Pioneers! most effectively illustrates the claim?
A. “She had never known before how much the country meant to her. The chirping of the insects down in the long grass had been
like the sweetest music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding down there, somewhere, with the quail and the plover and all
the little wild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun. Under the long shaggy ridges, she felt the future stirring.”
B. “Alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a whole day with one young
farmer who had been away at school, and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a great deal.”
C. “Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but her lantern, held ﬁrmly between her
feet, made a moving point of light along the highway, going deeper and deeper into the dark country.”
D. “It was Alexandra who read the papers and followed the markets, and who learned by the mistakes of their neighbors. It was
Alexandra who could always tell about what it had cost to fatten each steer, and who could guess the weight of a hog before it
went on the scales closer than John Bergson [her father] himself.”
ID: 0770b53d Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most directly illustrates the claim that Cather portrays
Alexandra as having a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings. This quotation states that the country meant a
great deal to Alexandra and then goes on to detail several ways in which her natural surroundings affect her emotionally: the
insects sound like “the sweetest music,” she feels as though “her heart were hiding” in the grass “with the quail and the plover,” and
near the ridges she feels “the future stirring.”
Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra had a deep emotional connection to her natural
surroundings but instead describes how she interacts with the people around her to learn more about crops, poultry, and
experiments with clover hay. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t suggest that Alexandra has a deep emotional
connection to her natural surroundings but instead describes her nighttime departure in a wagon. The quotation says nothing
about Alexandra’s emotional state. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t convey Alexandra’s deep emotional
connection to her natural surroundings; instead, this quotation describes how well she understands the markets and livestock.

Question ID 58e9e497
ID: 58e9e497
In the early nineteenth century, some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States used agricultural techniques
developed by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people centuries earlier, but it seems that few of those farmers had actually seen
Haudenosaunee farms ﬁrsthand. Barring the possibility of several farmers of the same era independently developing techniques
that the Haudenosaunee people had already invented, these facts most strongly suggest that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. those farmers learned the techniques from other people who were more directly inﬂuenced by Haudenosaunee practices.
B. the crops typically cultivated by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were not well suited to
Haudenosaunee farming techniques.
C. Haudenosaunee farming techniques were widely used in regions outside the northeastern United States.
D. Euro-American farmers only began to recognize the beneﬁts of Haudenosaunee farming techniques late in the nineteenth
century.
ID: 58e9e497 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Euro-American farmers’ use of
Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques. According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the
early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be
that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee
people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn’t learn these techniques from direct
observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn’t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that
they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly inﬂuenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers
themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those
practices to their own farming.
Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using
Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops
typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ crops were ill suited
to the techniques, it’s unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates
only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that
these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American
farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American
farmers were beginning to recognize the beneﬁts of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only
began to recognize the beneﬁts of the techniques much later.

Question ID 1a2b29c9

The following text is adapted from María Cristina Mena’s 1914 short story “The Vine-Leaf.”
It is a saying in the capital of Mexico that Dr. Malsufrido carries more family secrets under his hat than any archbishop.
The doctor’s hat is, appropriately enough, uncommonly capacious, rising very high, and sinking so low that it seems to be
supported by his ears and eyebrows, and it has a furry look, as if it had been brushed the wrong way, which is perhaps what
happens to it if it is ever brushed at all. When the doctor takes it off, the family secrets do not ﬂy out like a ﬂock of parrots,
but remain nicely bottled up beneath a dome of old and highly polished ivory.
Based on the text, how do people in the capital of Mexico most likely regard Dr. Malsufrido?
A. Many have come to tolerate him despite his disheveled appearance.
B. Few feel concerned that he will divulge their conﬁdences.
C. Some dislike how freely he discusses his own family.
D. Most would be unimpressed by him were it not for his professional expertise.
ID: 1a2b29c9 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a saying in the capital that Malsufrido keeps more secrets than an archbishop. It
also says that when he takes off his hat, “the family secrets do not ﬂy out… but remain nicely bottled up,” suggesting that he will
not betray his conﬁdences.
Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t reﬂect the text. While his hat is large and appears to have been brushed in the wrong
direction, Dr. Malsufrido does not seem to be regarded as ill-dressed or disheveled. Choice C is incorrect. This choice is the
opposite of what the text says. The secrets of families (his and others’) remain “bottled up” in his head. Choice D is incorrect. This
choice isn’t supported by the text. His professional expertise is not discussed in the passage.

Question ID 71904085

Linguist Deborah Tannen has cautioned against framing contentious issues in terms of two highly competitive perspectives, such
as pro versus con. According to Tannen, this debate-driven approach can strip issues of their complexity and, when used in front
of an audience, can be less informative than the presentation of multiple perspectives in a noncompetitive format. To test
Tannen’s hypothesis, students conducted a study in which they showed participants one of three different versions of local news
commentary about the same issue. Each version featured a debate between two commentators with opposing views, a panel of
three commentators with various views, or a single commentator.
Which ﬁnding from the students’ study, if true, would most strongly support Tannen’s hypothesis?
A. On average, participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable about the issue than commentators in
the panel.
B. On average, participants perceived commentators in the panel as more knowledgeable about the issue than the single
commentator.
C. On average, participants who watched the panel correctly answered more questions about the issue than those who watched
the debate or the single commentator did.
D. On average, participants who watched the single commentator correctly answered more questions about the issue than those
who watched the debate did.
ID: 71904085 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it presents the ﬁnding that, if true, would most strongly support Tannen’s hypothesis.
According to the text, Tannen’s hypothesis is that multiple perspectives presented in a noncompetitive format is more informative
than a debate between opposing viewpoints is. If participants who saw a panel of three commentators with various views about
an issue answered more questions about the issue correctly than did participants who saw a debate, that would support Tannen’s
hypothesis since it would show that participants who heard multiple varied perspectives were better informed than were
participants who heard a debate between opposing viewpoints.
Choice A is incorrect because ﬁnding that participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable than
commentators in the panel is irrelevant to Tannen’s hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more
informative to the audience than presenting opposing views of the issue is. Participants’ perception of how knowledgeable
panelists are has no bearing on how much participants learn from the panelists. Choice B is incorrect because ﬁnding that
participants perceived commentators in the panel as more knowledgeable than a single commentator is irrelevant to Tannen’s
hypothesis, which is that presenting multiple perspectives on an issue is more informative to the audience than presenting
opposing views of the issue is. Participants’ perception of how knowledgeable panelists are has no bearing on how much
participants learn from the panelists, and Tannen’s hypothesis says nothing about how informative single commentators are.
Choice D is incorrect because ﬁnding that participants who watched a single commentator answered more questions correctly
than participants who watched the debate did wouldn’t be relevant to Tannen’s hypothesis, which is that hearing multiple varying
perspectives is more informative than hearing a debate. Tannen’s hypothesis says nothing about how informative single
commentators are.
